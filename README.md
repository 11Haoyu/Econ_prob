## Summer preparatory course for MSc students at CUHK

Last update: June 5, 2019

Welcome to the summer short course *Probability and Statistics* at CUHK.

In the previous years, I taught the probability part of and a colleague of mine covered the statistics part. I used to develop my notes from measure theory, which was very technical for many MSc students. This year I will experiment with something new. I will borrow as reference Kevin Sheppard's notes for [MSc in Financial Economics](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/Category:MFE) at Oxford University.
