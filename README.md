# Probability and Statistics


**Zhentao Shi**

**(2022 summer, CUHK)**

Welcome to the 2022 summer short course for MSc.

## Contents

Three topics will be covered:
* [Probability](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob/blob/master/01_prob.ipynb)
* [Statistic](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob/blob/master/02_stat.ipynb)
* [Basic asymptotics](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob/blob/master/03_asym.ipynb)

The contents can be found in the Jupyter notebook lecture notes, which can be displayed in a web browser in a static form.

## Interactive code

The following approaches make it possible to interact with the code cells in the Jupyter notebooks.

1. Download to your local computer the Github repository. Copy and paste `git clone https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob.git` in a terminal if the Git system is installed.
2. Log in CUHK Econ's [SCRP server](https://scrp-login-2.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/jupyter). Git and R kernels are already installed there. Download the Github repos by copy and paste `git clone https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob.git`
3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Download the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ztshi/msc_prob_and_stat) for this course by running `docker pull ztshi/msc_prob_and_stat` in a terminal. The Github repository is already written in the folder. Run `docker run -p 10000:8888 ztshi/msc_prob_and_stat` in a terminal. A token must be copied to log in the web browser interface.
`

Note:

* If you modify the code or text, the above approaches 1 and 2 allow you to save your changes.
* Originally the following is the most convenient option. However, the configuration does not seem to work, due to the capacity that `mybinder` offers.
    4. Click the online [binder server](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob/HEAD). It may take some time to build the environment. Be patient. Changes cannot be saved in approach 4, and thus they will get lost after closing your web browser.


## Extensive reading
Besides the lecture notes in this Github repository, you will find self-contained lecture notes in the first two chapters of
Kevin Sheppard's [Financial Economics I](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/teaching/mfe/notes/) for MSc at Oxford University.

## Course Page
The [course web page](https://zhentaoshi.github.io/Econ_prob/) is the same as this README file.
